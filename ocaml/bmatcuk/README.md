# Longest-Run-of-Pairs

A solution of [FPUGS/Longest-Run-of-Pairs](https://github.com/FPUGS/Longest-Run-of-Pairs) in OCaml.

## Run the Things!

1. [Install OCaml](http://ocaml.org/)
2. Make!
  
  ```
  make
  ```
3. Run!
  
  ```
  ./adjacency
  ```

Ignore the "not exhaustive" error... the missing case can never happen and I'm too lazy to fix the code to remove the warning.
